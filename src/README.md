Iteratively-reweighted Multivariate Alteration Detection (iMAD)
===============================================================

This package implements Nielsen's iMAD algorithm. It is a C++ program
ported from Python, with the eventual goal of making an R package.

### Required Packages

To build iMad, you will need the GDAL libraries, which can be acquired from
the [OSGEO website](http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/DownloadingGdalBinaries).

Note: we still need to check the above link (K. Song, 2014-07-12)

You will also need the Eigen libraries, which can be found [here](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page).
Note that Eigen is a header-only library.

### Building

Still in progress :(
