/**** Notes on tile matrix ****/
/* tile is a strange name for a matrix (borrowed from the python code).
 * It holds a single row of both images. The top half of the matrix holds
 * the row from file1, with all of its bands in separate rows (e.g. for any
 * given row, row 1 of tile will hold image1, band1, row 2 will hold image1,
 * band2, etc.). The same is true of the second image in the bottom
 * half of tile. Note that this tile is transposed compared to the one in
 * Python: Pyversion has rows in cols and files split left/right. */

/**** Notes on numbered lines in imad() ****/
/* While going through these, it is helpful to remember that left multiplying by
 * a diagonal matrix (D*A) multiplies each row by the diagonal element, i.e.
 * row1(A) = row1(A) * D(1,1), row2(A) = row2(A) * D(2,2), etc. and right-multiplying
 * by a diagonal matrix multiplies the columns instead of the rows. Off we go!*/

/* 1 */ /* Completely unintelligible. First, we take the diagonal of s11. We then
 * cast it to an array (to deal with some issues with eigen), then take an
 * element-wise inverse square root. We then revert it back to a diagonal matrix.
 * The end effect is identical to masking all but the diagonal of s11, then
 * taking an element-wise inverse square root. */

/* 2 */ /* s is actually a row-vector. Not sure what this actually does */

/* 3 */ /* If S(i,i) was negative, we set it to -1. Otherwise, we set it to +1.
 * We then multiply A by this matrix to ensure the correlation sum is positive
 * (Yes, this part feels like magic to me too). */
